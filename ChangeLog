    Disable database logging by default.
    
    It can be re-enabled using --enable-dblog
    
    Until we actually start using this data somewhere there is not much
    point in storing it. Since it's already known that writing to the
    database can affect I/O performance, especially where drives are
    shared with recordings, this could potentially even cause a positive
    feedback loop. The I/O starvation causes the backend to start logging
    slow read/write warnings, which in turn increase the writes to the
    database exacerbating the problems.
    
    The same problem is also true, to a greater or lesser extent with file
    based logging but we actually need the file logs so there isn't much
    we can do there.
