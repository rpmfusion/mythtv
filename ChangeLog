    Fiddle with the theme template regular expression for #12003
    
    It appears that \w worked for a long time. But does not match #
    so it was changed to \S which matches everything but white space.
    
    Now try with \w and explicit #.
    
    The regexp is tested with online tools.
    (I couldn't get QRegExp-Editor to build and refactoring to suit unit
    tests didn't look easy)
    
    Fixes #12003

    Re-Enable screensaver-x11 after the dbus screensaver support was added.
    
    This now utilizes the dbus screensaver first, and then the previously
    existing screensaver methods. This should resolve the issues seen by
    those using only DPMS or xscreensaver.

    Fix lirc being ignored after dbus screen saver changes.
    
    If the Screensaver is Asleep() we ignore all keypresses
    generated via the remote. This is clearly so that a button
    pressed on the remote while the screen is asleep only wakes
    up the screen, rather than triggering an action.
    
    This swaps the logic around in the dbus screensaver so that
    it satisfies the Asleep() check.
    
    We may need to revist this in the future if we find that
    when using the dbus screensaver we are not ignoring the
    remote keypress which is used to bring us out of screensave.

    Internet Content: Replace precompiled vimeo_data.pyc with the source vimeo_data.py.
    
    vimeo_data.pyc was byte-compiled for python 2.6 and didn't work with any other
    python versions.
    
    vimeo_data.py holds the API key for connecting to vimeo.  It it obfuscated,
    however other projects do keep their key in the open.

    Internet Content: Adapt the YouTube grabber to the v3 API
    
    It is possible to set two optional parameters in ~/.mythtv/MythNetvision/userGrabberPrefs/youtube.xml:
    * API key
    * Region code used for retrieving the categories in the tree view
    
    Some changes were also required in libmyth and MythNetvision due to the way
    paging is handled.
    
    This bumps the ABI version.
