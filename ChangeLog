    mythmusic: Save playlists to DB when changed not at frontend exit
    
    This changes things so any changes to playlists are saved to the database
    immediately rather than cached and saved when the frontend exits.
    
    This fixes a problem were you could lose edits to a playlist if the FE is not
    shutdown cleanly like when using the idle timer to shutdown or if you shutdown
    the computer from the FE exit menu.

    MythNews: improve media:content parsing in rss feeds
    
    * use the medium or type attributes to determine whether the content is an
      image or video. Previously we ignored the type and ended up trying to play
      an image.
    
    * if we haven't found any thumbnail image then use any images found in the
      media:content as the thumbnail. Fixes #11161.
    
    * parse all the media:content items not just the first one we find.

    Warn about reliance on the XMLTV 'TimeOffset' setting which has been
    removed in 0.27
    
    The XMLTV specification states that dates and times must be either in
    GMT/UTC or specify an offset from GMT/UTC in ISO8601 format. Since the
    'offset' setting has caused so much confusion over the years we're
    removing it and requiring all xmltv input to follow the specs.
    
    This change also sets the default for this setting to 'Auto' which it
    should have been from the beginning.

    Change MythDate::toString() to return an empty string for invalid inputs.
    
    Cherry picked from master for fixes/0.26.
    
    It's possible a "0000-00-00 00:00:00" might be somewhat acceptable in
    some rare cases because the all 0s value obviously represents a
    special value.  The UTC to local conversions added in 0.26, however,
    now causes it to change to a less obviously special, and perhaps even
    misledaing, not all 0s value.  Since MythDate::toString() was a
    Myth-specific replacement for QDateTime::toString() and
    QDate::toString() and those functions return an empty string for
    invalid inputs, we probably should too.

    keyframe.
    
    Especially with H.264, we can be several packets into a payload before we
    know if it is a keyframe or just a frame or something else.  Always buffer
    the packets of a payload until we know what we are doing with the payload.
    
    If we need to switch ringbuffers, we now do it so the new file will start at
    the beginning of the payload holding a keyframe.  Each file will also start
    with a PAT/PMT if the "recorder" calls for it.

    fix issue #10222: mythcommflag segfaulting
    
    The problem in issue #10222 is that it is adding the CODEC_FLAG2_FAST flag. Â This causes unsafe functions to be used, causing a segfault. The proper way to fix this would probably be to figure out how to test for the "experimental speedups" flag, however I don't know the codebase well enough for this.
    
    I tested how this would affect the speed of mythcommflag on one of my recordings. Â The results:
    
    Before removing flag:

    After removing flag:

    Fix h.264 frame/keyframe identification in the player.
    
    If a NAL unit that determines a frame start appears as the last NAL
    unit in the packet, then the frame start is not identified until the
    start of the next packet.  If this new packet has its own NAL unit
    that determines a frame start, and that NAL unit is not at the end of
    the packet, then only one frame start would be counted rather than
    two.  This is fixed by returning the total number of frame starts,
    rather than a bool.
    
    In theory, the same problem could exist in the recorder, but it
    appears that the packets in the original recording may have some
    trailing NAL units that are stripped by the ffmpeg libraries when
    assembling the packet for the player, causing the situation not to
    occur.

    cleans up the bottom 8 lines by applying a crop filter to the source.
    This is tested for the XVideo output method.
    
    The VDPAU output method does not use the standard filter mechanism,
    but it works fine on 1088-line video until the h.264 parser thinks the
    resolution has changed from 1080 to 1088 lines.  To compensate, we
    don't acknowledge a resolution change when this happens.

    Fix Live TV startup, particularly for analog PVR-xxx tuners.
    
    At the start of playback, ffmpeg scans the start of the file for
    stream info.  While reading packets, it uses ffio_limit() to truncate
    packets during attempts to read past the size of the file.  The file
    size is cached at the start of playback, and may be inordinately small
    for live TV files, triggering a storm of packet truncation and failure
    to start playback.  We fix this by faking a large file size for live
    TV playback during the initial call to avformat_find_stream_info().

    Fix issues which sometimes prevente scheduling around live TV.
    
    Backport of SHA1:b05ecd46 to fixes/0.26.
    
    There are some cases where we don't attempt to schedule around live
    TV.  This change cleans up the logic which determines when to do that
    and fixes some of the bugs found in the process.
    
    NB: the case where a user enters live TV immediately before a
    recording is scheduled to start is still not handled gracefully.
    Fixing that is a lot tougher and will likely mean involving the
    scheduler in choosing which input to use for live TV.

    Simplify DVD startup to improve playback reliability
    
    The startup code for DVD playback jumps around somewhat trying to find
    a playable title, which is then used to create audio/video decoders
    before playback is restarted at firstplay.
    
    This doesn't always work as it can leave the DVDs VM in an
    inconsistent state and, depending on the DVD, looks ugly as playback
    starts and then restarts or appears to jump somewhere else after a
    couple of seconds. Because the VM can be left in an inconsistent
    state, menu navigation/selection issues can arise, which can make it
    difficult to start playback.
    
    The attached patch attempts to clean up the startup code. The
    DVDRingBuffer no longer tries to find a playable title in OpenFile??,
    but rather just lets the VM get on with playback. AVFormatDecoder no
    longer processes the initial frames more than is required to create
    decoders. Once this has been achieved, any cached data is flushed
    before jumping back to 'firstplay' (and cleanly resetting the VM). By
    not displaying the initial frames used to determine the decoders and
    flushing the cached data, the ugly jump at the start of some DVDs is
    no longer visible.

    mythccextractor: Fix teletext subtitle duration
    
    Previously ProcessTeletext() didn't leave one subtitle behind.  This caused the
    length calculation in IngestSubtitle() to never be performed, which meant that
    the length was always set to the default value 750 ms.
    
    Fixes #11081.

    Configure the h.264 parser to identify only IDR keyframes.
    
    This makes keyframes identified by "mythcommflag --rebuild" and
    mythtranscode much closer to reality, though there are still
    discrepancies compared to the recorder and raw ffmpeg.

    Bump MDM::downloadNow() timeout up to 60 seconds.
    
    The previous 10-second timeout was causing issues when trying to
    download large lineups from Schedules Direct. This commit bumps
    the downloadNow() timeout to 60 seconds.  This is a blocking call,
    so if the caller doesn't want to potentially block for that long,
    they should be use one of the non-blocking methods.
    
    References #11287.

    Fix an issue with keyframe positions produced by mythcommflag --rebuild.
    
    The seeking code in DecoderBase assumes there is a keyframe at frame
    0, otherwise it shifts all keyframe numbers by the value of the first
    keyframe number in the map.  This causes problems for recordings with
    variable keyframe distances.  To correct this, make sure mythcommflag
    --rebuild creates an explicit entry for frame 0.
    
    Note: this does not fix the issue of mythcommflag --rebuild adding
    bogus keyframes to the seektable for h.264 recordings.

    Allow posixtzinfo to use the TZ environmental variable.
    
    This adds a check for the TZ environmental variable, and uses that to
    define the local timezone if available, rather than always using
    /etc/localtime. This resolves an issue on Debian-based systems that
    always use the TZ variable, rather than defining the localtime file.

    Temporary fix for stuttery playback of AVI files over Storage Group.
    
    This is a reverse of ffmpeg SHA1:8df774be88c347c40f1b2411ed9e391dfec0ebb7

    This is not a proper fix. It only reveals an issue with myth Storage Group file ring buffer.
    With this ffmpeg change, some AVI files are detected as non-interleaved and the readahead thread starts to pull MB of data which saturates 100Mbit/s link causing the video playback to stutter.

    Properly initialize the MythPlayer::video_aspect field.
    
    The MythPlayer constructor unconditionally initializes video_aspect to
    4.0/3.0.  In some configurations, pressing EDIT during the "Please
    Wait" screen before the start of playback of a non-4:3 recording, will
    bring up the cutlist editor locked into 4:3 mode.  Explicitly
    initializing video_aspect earlier fixes this.

    Fix immutable methods in Artwork class.
    
    This fixes an issue with several immutable methods in the Artwork class,
    inherited from the parent UserString class. As the Artwork class is
    modified for use as a property, and not intended to be called directly
    for storage of a string, the inherited UserString methods that returned
    a new instance using the __class__ attribute would fail. This adds a
    __new__ method that detects such uses and forces the call to return a
    standard str type instead.

    Add reporting of logging volume to Smolt.
    
    This reports the logging volume as a percentage of the total amount
    stored in the database, for each urgency level. This is intended as a
    simple metric to determine stability of MythTV, as higher counts of
    higher urgency levels will indicate an increase in problems seen by the
    user base.

    libmythui: Fix a redraw bug in MythUIType
    
    While evaluating the ATI Catalyst 'TearFree Desktop' option I noticed
    that sometimes a keypress was apparently being held up until the time
    on the main menu was updated.  Initially I thought that this was a lirc
    or fglrx issue, but on investigation it turned out that MythMainWindow::animate
    was requesting updates for empty repaint regions.  Delving further
    showed that MythUIType::Draw was resetting m_DirtyRegion to empty
    even if the clipRect was smaller, thus leaving unpainted regions.
    
    m_DirtyRegion may be extended by HandleMovementPulse, SetRedraw
    or SetChildNeedsRedraw etc AFTER GetDirtyArea is called.
    So when MythUIType::Draw is called, clipRect may not include the whole
    of m_DirtyRegion.
    
    This patch subtracts the Draw clipRect from m_DirtyRegion instead of
    simply emtying it.
