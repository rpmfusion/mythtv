    Fix immutable methods in Artwork class.
    
    This fixes an issue with several immutable methods in the Artwork class,
    inherited from the parent UserString class. As the Artwork class is
    modified for use as a property, and not intended to be called directly
    for storage of a string, the inherited UserString methods that returned
    a new instance using the __class__ attribute would fail. This adds a
    __new__ method that detects such uses and forces the call to return a
    standard str type instead.

    Refs #10948. Fully randomize EIT crawl start time.
    
    The deadlocks we've been seeing here should be fixed now, but they
    should have been rare to begin with due to randomization of the
    EIT Scanning start time. But they were occurring at fairly high
    frequency. It turns out we were not applying enough randomness when
    there were multiple cards and we were also losing randomness after
    the first recording on a tuner finished and we reset the clock.

    Fixes #10970. Fix StreamHandler restart race.
    
    We wait for _running to be set to false, but we need the thread to be
    in the finish state or QThread::start() will exit silently without
    starting the thread. Since we're calling QThread::wait() we don't
    really need the while (_running) loop at all in either Start() or
    Stop(), so I've removed it. This race probably dates back to the
    pthread->QThread porting.

    Hopefully remove more scheduler/recorder deadlocks.
    
    Change the scheduler to unlock schedLock when calling the recorder
    synchronously.  If the recorder happens to be calling the scheduler at
    the same time, this allows the recorder's call to grab the lock as
    needed.

    Protect the reschedule queue with a seperate lock to fix a backend deadlock.
    
     Fixes a deadlock in mythbackend caused when a reschedule request occurs
     immedately prior to a recording starting.
    
     The recorder thread locks the scheduler when starting a recording. The pending
     reschedule request handled in the event loop waits for the scheduler lock to be
     released blocking the event loop. The backend is now stopped from handling any
     further events or protocol requests, meanwhile the recorder is waiting on
     events to be processed before it will release the lock resulting in an
     irrecoverable deadlock (or hang) and the failure of the recording.
    
     This deadlock was more likely to be triggered for users of EIT because it will
     ask for a reschedule every 5 minutes in addition to any reschedules triggered
     through other means.

    situation worse in 0.25 and I really don't have the time to figure out
    why. Anyone experiencing the pre-existing deadlock will need to
    upgrade to 0.26 when it's released. Refs #10771

    Move QUERY_FILETRANSFER handling to improve backend performance.
    
    This significantly reduces the backend CPU usage for me when streaming a
    recording or other file to the frontend.
    
    Each time we send a command to the backend we perform a number of string
    comparisons to find the correct handler. In the cases where that same command
    is sent regularly, maybe several times a second those comparisons can stack up
    to result in a high CPU load. This can be avoided by moving the most frequently
    used commands to the top of the list thereby avoiding a couple of dozen or more
    comparisons each time.
    
    There may be other commands that should be moved to the top with similar
    benefit.

    Subtitles: Be less aggressive about auto-selecting a forced track.
    
    1. Don't favor a forced subtitle track if DefaultCCMode=1 (i.e., the
    user already wants subtitles or captions which are likely to also
    contain the force subtitles).
    
    2. Don't favor a forced subtitle track if AllowForcedSubtitles=0
    (i.e., the user doesn't want to be inflicted with forced subtitles).
    
    3. Only favor a forced track if it is a subtitle track.  (Do any other
    track types ever have the forced flag set?)
    
    Note that this still may not be perfect, e.g. a user may end up
    auto-displaying cc608 captions where a forced subtitle track is still
    needed for the complete experience.

    Improve file cache performance.
    
    This reworks the cache framework, and alters the file cache engine to
    support incremental writes. This allows the results from 256 queries to
    be stored before having to rewrite the file. Previously, having to
    rewrite the entire cache file on each step would take longer than
    actually querying TMDB once the cache stored more than ~100 entries.
    
    May be a bit fragile.

    Allow locale fallthrough for movie images and alternate titles.
    
    When fallthrough is enabled, queries for backdrops, posters, and
    alternate titles will not filter for the selected locale, but will
    instead sort the results to place those matching the specified locale at
    the top of the list.
    
    Also resolves an issue where Request() was incorrectly passing 'None' as
    an argument when no locale was set.

    Attempt to fix most issues in IPTV recorder.
    
    IPTV recording is broken, this commit make things better, but it doesn't solve all issues.
    - Tuning wasn't working, it was searching for a freqid on a recorder that doesn't have any, only a channel number
    - When playback startup was interrupted (like the frontend exiting) or an error occurs during SignalMonitor, the IPTV stream wasn't killed, resulting in a recorder being stuck forever in "in-use" mode (ref: #10493)
    - When recording was going, it would have been impossible to stop the recorder, and TVRec would have just waited forever.
    
    Also add some logging.

    Fix file handle leaks in oggvorbis and wavpack tag readers. These, along with one in the flac tag reader were caused when we stopped using an instance of the Taglib::FileRef class to read the track length. Taglib::FileRef would take ownership of the pointer and delete it when we were done, now that we're not using Taglib::FileRef we're again responsible for deleting the object which in turn closes the open file handle.

    Specify MySQL storage engine for mfdb temp tables.
    
    Since MySQL 5.5 changes the default storage engine to InnoDB, and since
    many distros configure the InnoDB file path to refer to a directory on a
    file system with barriers enabled, any temporary tables written to disk
    will be written as InnoDB tables on the InnoDB file path, rather than
    using MyISAM tables, which can be stored on the tmpdir.  This results in
    severe performance issues when using mythfilldatabase with Schedules
    Direct data.  Therefore, specify the use of MyISAM storage engine for
    mythfilldatabase DataDirect temporary tables.

    The HD-PVR does not behave well when told to switch encoding on/off

    if the HD-PVR has stabilized: If the driver reports the same resolution
    consistently for two seconds, then assume a good lock.

    Ensure the default parental level is set before we Load() the video data. This was seemingly always backwards which caused the data to be loaded twice. It was then broken by 7c8e45f which moved the signal connection to the right place but overlooked the misplaced ParentalLevel::SetLevel(). To recap, we want to connect the SigLevelChanged() signal _after_ the initial load otherwise we'd always trigger a second unwanted load.

    Remove the broken "Expire in deleted order" setting.
    
    Unfortunately, this setting has been broken since the day it was
    committed.  When disabled, this setting could cause non-deleted
    programs to be expired before deleted programs when the Auto
    Expirer was trying to free up disk space.  The desired effect
    of the setting is now already handled by default, expiring deleted
    programs in a FIFO order on a particular filesystem.  The first
    program deleted is the first to be expired for disk space if
    necessary.

    Add a playback OSD menu option to cancel an in-progress playlist.
    
    Previously, the only way to stop playlist playback was to execute a
    jump point, as EXIT simply moves to the next playlist item.  Now, the
    playback OSD menu, "Playback" submenu, has a "Cancel Playlist" entry,
    with the effect that when playback ends, it returns to the Watch
    Recordings screen instead of the next playlist entry.
    
    Note: This adds a currently untranslated string to the Playback
    submenu of the playback OSD menu when a playlist is active.

    Fix assumption that ints would be initialised to zero in JobQueueEntry, this isn't the case with C++. It appears that this would have caused any job that didn't include a chanid to abort even though the code indicates that it's perfectly valid to have a job which doesn't operate on a recording and wouldn't require the chanid. I don't know enough about the intended behaviour to say whether this will fix a user-visible bug ... Discovered by Coverity.

    Fix the 1299 DB upgrade (DeletedMaxAge update).
    
    The 1299 upgrade modifies DeletedMaxAge for its new meaning, now that
    AutoExpireInsteadOfDelete is always enabled.  Previously, 0 meant
    "expire when out of disk space" and was the default value; but after
    f78f9992 , 0 means "expire immediately" and -1 means "expire when out of
    disk space."  Both before and after f78f9992, any positive value means
    to expire recording files that many days after deletion.
    
    However, the setting DeletedMaxAge was only ever written to the database
    if the user enabled AutoExpireInsteadOfDelete (triggering the
    DeletedExpireOptions TriggeredConfigurationGroup) and modified
    DeletedMaxAge to some value other than its default of 0.  Therefore,
    most users did not actually have a value for DeletedMaxAge in their
    databases--whether they had enabled AutoExpireInsteadOfDelete or not.
    
    The DB upgrade needs to change DeletedMaxAge to -1 if and only if
    AutoExpireInsteadOfDelete is enabled and DeletedMaxAge has a value of 0
    (or is still using the default).  Because of the condition on the
    update, it did nothing for users with AutoExpireInsteadOfDelete enabled
    but without a value for DeletedMaxAge in the database.  This resulted in
    their systems changing from "expire when out of space" to "expire
    immediately".
    
    Thanks to Thomas Boehm and Peter on the mythtv-users mailing list for
    noticing that their settings didn't carry over through the update.

    Turns out the problem we are seeing is a known bug in Qt 4.7.1 that is fixed

    In particular, if your Schedules Direct username is an email address, Qt4.7.1
    stupidly puts the username as the part before the @ and the realm as the
    portion after the @, even though the realm was already provided.
    
    SO, if you have a Schedules Direct username that is an email address, either
    upgrade to 4.7.2 (or higher), or downgrade to 4.7.0 (or lower).

    Various fixes in Airplay
    
    Fixes:
    -Playback on frontend always start at the beginning, iOS continuing to play where left off.
    -Scrubbing not working
    -Playback position on frontend and iOS device not in sync
    -When quitting playback on iOS, video continue on frontend.
    -When quitting playback on frontend, iOS not notified and playback counter continues progressing
    
    There's still a minor cosmetic defect, when scrubbing quickly and the iOS device pause playback, the positions between the frontend and iOS device are not in sync. It will become in sync only once playback resume.
    
    MythTV doesn't handle http live streaming playback yet, so Airplay will not work with some applications (in particular AirVideo) streaming via HLS

    Always re-use the same computer ID for AirPlay. Share ID between RAOP and AirPlay
    
    Random ID is generated the first time, the following session will always re-use the same ID.
    Having AirPlay and RAOP share the same hardware ID makes mythfrontend behave more like an AppleTV: only one device is showing in the list. Either one for audio or one for audio+video, not both at the same time.

    Almost complete rewrite of RAOP server
    
    Let me commend Mark Kendall for his previous implementation. As far as I could tell, his RAOP server was the only one implementing Airtunes v2 functionalities with a/v sync timestamps.
    The rewrite serves several purposes. Mainly, I wanted to take ownership of this area of the code, and there were things I couldn't figure out. Most likely because whatever Mark used for AirPort's technical documentation isn't what I got.
    Technical description of RAOP came mostly from:
    -http://git.zx2c4.com/Airtunes2/about
    -http://blog.technologeek.org/airtunes-v2
    
    I found the later to be the most correct.
    
    Main area of focus:
    -Audio Quality: Over slow or poor network connectivity (e.g. slow wireless) and with lots of packet drops: audio would have been corrupted (the system played audio packets in the order they were received, and not in the order they were supposed to be). For testing purposes, I simulated a 30% packet drop, and playback remained perfect.
    -A/V Sync: Achieving perfect A/V sync across all platforms and with all the different type of audio architecture is almost impossible. However, I believe the results achieved are very good. Playback will automatically adjust itself according to the network latency and the audio hardware latency.
    
    New features:
    We now retrieve the media's metadata: Album name, artist name, song title and coverart. This only works when using iTunes. iOS device do not send metadata unless using FairPlay encryption. We only support RSA encryption.
    Currently, this information is only shown in the logs, but in the future we'll be able to nicely show them in mythfrontend.
    
    Additional credits:
    -http://nto.github.com/AirPlay.html, gave information about how to configure Bonjour in order to receive MetaData from iTunes
    -http://code.google.com/p/ytrack/wiki/DMAP : iTunes DMAP metadata structure

    Add ability to override Bonjour's service name.
    
    This is a work around a more complex issue.
    By default, Bonjour would automatically detect the computer name and use it to advertise the server.
    
    From Bonjour man-page:
    "If non-NULL, specifies the service name to be registered. Most applications will not specify a name, in which case the computer name is used (this name is communicated to the client via the callback). If a name is specified, it must be 1-63 bytes of UTF-8 text. If the name is longer than 63 bytes it will be automatically truncated to a legal length"
    
    However, for some people with broken DNS configuration, they can't resolve that name or it resolves improperly.
    So add a BonjourHostname setting to override the name used by Bonjour.
    
    Use it as an extra argument: -O BonjourHostname=mycomputer.

    Rework RAOP protocol handling
    
    This commit fixes several issues in the RAOP protocol initialisation. Major ones being:
    *iTunes compatibility. Playback from iTunes client now works (tested with both Mac and Windows version).
    *Commit 37385baff83eea77116d13e22be96b74cfde2cec broke playback rather significantly, the RAOP server would never received packets being re-issued resulting in audio drop-outs
    
    The core issue for iTunes not working previously was how the response packets were formed. The headers/content were inversed. This worked fine for iPhone/iPad but iTunes didn't like it.
    
    This commit doesn't fix some audio-sync issues and occasional glitches in playback. This will be done in a future commit

    Make sure passthru flag is in sync between video decoder and audio framework
    
    When entering LiveTV with timestretch enabled via playback group, audio would be broken if watching a channel with AC3 content.
    Reason being, audio is set for timestretch, but digital passthrough isn't disabled. We now make sure digital passthrough is disabled should timestretch had been activated earlier on.
    
    Additionally, add the ability to cancel timestretch and audio processing should we revert to a timestretch factor of 1.0. This will only work if no reconfigure is done in between.

    Fix non-responsive keyboard on mac
    
    QWidget::winId() forces a widget to be native. Why it causes some keyboard issues on mac I'm not sure. It's likely we don't need this call at all, including non-mac. Take the safe approach and only disable the call on mac

    Fix possible undefined behaviours in libmythprotoserver
    
    The intermediary QByteBuffer returned by toLocal8Bit would have been destroyed at the end of the expression, making the pointer used invalid.
    
    Wondering what kind of crash/instability this would have caused.
    I went through the whole code, and only found those two.

    Convert the use of player_ctx in mythtranscode to QPointer<>
    
    We have far too many places in the transcode code path that delete player_ctx
    and return.  Unfortunately, freeing "transcode" also will try to delee
    player_ctx, but it's already deleted, and not nulled out.  Rather than putting
    many instances of "player_ctx = NULL", I opted to make PlayerContext a
    QObject, and then just use QPointer<PlayerContext> as this will clear itself
    to NULL as soon as it is destroyed.

    Make sure passthru flag is in sync between video decoder and audio framework
    
    When entering LiveTV with timestretch enabled via playback group, audio would be broken if watching a channel with AC3 content.
    Reason being, audio is set for timestretch, but digital passthrough isn't disabled. We now make sure digital passthrough is disabled should timestretch had been activated earlier on.
    
    Additionally, add the ability to cancel timestretch and audio processing should we revert to a timestretch factor of 1.0. This will only work if no reconfigure is done in between.

    Fix Live TV channel changing when using Input Groups.
    
    When trying to change channels (either directly or through the program
    guide), an idle tuner in the same input group as the current tuner
    would not be considered available.
    
    This is fixed by adding the excluded_cardids argument to
    RemoteRequestFreeRecorderList() and
    RemoteRequestFreeRecorderFromList().
    
    Doing this the "right" way would require a protocol change for the
    GET_FREE_RECORDER_LIST command.  This is better done closer to the end
    of the 0.26 release cycle, so the current implementation is less
    efficient and makes multiple queries.
    
    There is also a lot of vector<> code here that could stand to be
    converted to QVector<>.

    Fixes #10566.  Reverts part of 3a51b833e to improve channel changes.
    
    The first half of 3a51b833e looks like a bug (the new condition means
    the following "else if" branch is never taken).  Removing it stops
    guide-based channel changes from being forced onto a different tuner.
    
    Note: this fix exposes another problem with guide-based channel
    changes - you can't switch to a different tuner in the current input
    group.  Fix is in progress.
