    Add missing toUTC() conversions in the preview generator.
    
    Without these conversions, modification timestamps on
    backend-generated preview files are reported in local time, but
    interpreted by the frontend as UTC.  The frontend then converts this
    to local time and uses that to set the modification timestamp of the
    locally cached preview, effectively back-dating the cached file in
    most time zones.  This messes up date comparison logic for determining
    whether to regenerate or reload the preview image.

    Force use of tmdb3.py when user tries to use tmdb.py.
    
    Since the tmdb.py grabber using the old v2.1 API is no longer
    functional, and we cannot issue a schema update to force users on the
    -fixes branches to transition to it, this detects when users attempt to
    run that grabber, and automatically replace it with the new grabber.

    Allow system calls to pull global settings from the database.
    
    This adjusts the System() class to first try local settings of the
    supplied value, fall back to global settings, and then the supplied
    default, before finally erroring. This corrects an issue where the
    VideoGrabber() child class did not properly pull the global settings for
    TelevisionGrabber and MovieGrabber, and thus just used the internal
    defaults.

    Subtitles: Remove extraneous character in embedded text subtitles.
    
    The NUL character at the end of the C string was accidentally being
    included as part of the subtitle string, and rendered to the screen.
    This affected only "raw text" subtitles directly embedded into the
    video.  Fixes #11855.

    Add handling for 'null' results in TheMovieDb searches.
    
    This adds handling for a temporary issue on TheMovieDb where the API can
    return 'null' results for a search when the movie has been deleted but
    not yet flushed from the cache servers.

    Have pager return Nones if the server returns null.
    
    This temporarily resolves an issue where the TheMovieDb server returns
    nulls in searches when a movie has been deleted but not yet flushed out
    of the cache. This prevents the error internally, but does not attempt
    to re-order to remove the nulls, so is merely passing the issue onto the
    application using this library.

    Make sure smolt directory is created before trying to read from it.
    
    This makes sure the configuration storage directory has been created
    prior to attempting to use it. Smolt typically stores to /etc, and
    assumes the packager has created its desired directory. There is
    probably a cleaner place to put this code, but this is a catch-all for
    several files read from that directory.

    Try multiple MythTV executables when retrieving --version information
    
    This causes Smolt to try, in order, mythutil, mythbackend, and
    mythfrontend, when polling them for MythTV version information. This is
    to correct a situation where users return "Unknown" data because they
    were using 3rd party packages that did not provide the backend
    executable.

    Disable database logging by default.
    
    It can be re-enabled using --enable-dblog
    
    Until we actually start using this data somewhere there is not much
    point in storing it. Since it's already known that writing to the
    database can affect I/O performance, especially where drives are
    shared with recordings, this could potentially even cause a positive
    feedback loop. The I/O starvation causes the backend to start logging
    slow read/write warnings, which in turn increase the writes to the
    database exacerbating the problems.
    
    The same problem is also true, to a greater or lesser extent with file
    based logging but we actually need the file logs so there isn't much
    we can do there.
