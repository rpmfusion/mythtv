    Fix immutable methods in Artwork class.
    
    This fixes an issue with several immutable methods in the Artwork class,
    inherited from the parent UserString class. As the Artwork class is
    modified for use as a property, and not intended to be called directly
    for storage of a string, the inherited UserString methods that returned
    a new instance using the __class__ attribute would fail. This adds a
    __new__ method that detects such uses and forces the call to return a
    standard str type instead.

    Fix setting of values to Artwork property.
    
    This makes the Artwork property derived from a MutableString rather than
    a unicode type, allowing the setting of values to work properly, rather
    than merely by chance, and correcting an issue where importMetadata
    would not apply a coverart value to Video Library entries.

    Add reporting of logging volume to Smolt.
    
    This reports the logging volume as a percentage of the total amount
    stored in the database, for each urgency level. This is intended as a
    simple metric to determine stability of MythTV, as higher counts of
    higher urgency levels will indicate an increase in problems seen by the
    user base.

    libmythui: Fix a redraw bug in MythUIType
    
    While evaluating the ATI Catalyst 'TearFree Desktop' option I noticed
    that sometimes a keypress was apparently being held up until the time
    on the main menu was updated.  Initially I thought that this was a lirc
    or fglrx issue, but on investigation it turned out that MythMainWindow::animate
    was requesting updates for empty repaint regions.  Delving further
    showed that MythUIType::Draw was resetting m_DirtyRegion to empty
    even if the clipRect was smaller, thus leaving unpainted regions.
    
    m_DirtyRegion may be extended by HandleMovementPulse, SetRedraw
    or SetChildNeedsRedraw etc AFTER GetDirtyArea is called.
    So when MythUIType::Draw is called, clipRect may not include the whole
    of m_DirtyRegion.
    
    This patch subtracts the Draw clipRect from m_DirtyRegion instead of
    simply emtying it.
