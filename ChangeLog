    Allow multiple element names with different dependancies.
    
    MythUI only allows one element with a given "name", so allow a themer to
    specify names with an extension to make them unique:  Anthing after (and
    including) a '+' will be ignored when matching the name.  For example:
    
    <textarea name="description+sub" depends="subtitle">
    
    and
    
    <textarea name="description+notsub" depends="!subtitle">
    
    results in the appropriate definition for "description" to be used depending
    on if the "subtitle" element is available.
    
    I thought about making the "+dependancies" naming automatic, but if the
    themer is using inheritance, they may find the result unexpected.
    
    This currently only works with textareas.  It would be quite a bit more work
    to make it work with other types, and I have not been able to think of any
    benifit.
