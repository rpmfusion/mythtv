    MythDownloadManager: fix a bug when downloading URL's with percent encoding
    
    This avoids converting a url to a QUrl only to later use its toString() method
    which was causing problems with percent encoded URL's not being removed from the
    download queue because we ended up comparing a human readable URL with a percent
    encoded one.

    MythDownloadManager: add some logging to try to track down the 100% cpu bug
    
    This also allows the theme checker to be run once a minute rather than the
    usual once an hour to try to trigger the bug quicker. Setting the
    MYTHTV_DEBUGMDM environment variable will run the checker every minute.
    
    So for 0.27.4-fixes use :-

    Subtitles: Fix cc608 preamble indents.  Fixes #12051.
    
    Cherry-picked from 366c428708682420bbf53a301d145ca441aedbdd .
    
    Thanks to Helen (faginbagin) for the analysis and patch.
    
    As Helen points out in the ticket, it would be all-around better if we
    took an approach like the cc708 captions and rendered everything onto
    an internal grid of characters and then converted that to strings to
    draw on the screen, but that's a lot of work for a mostly deprecated
    caption format.

    UI: Optimize updates to MythUIButtonList when an item's state changes
    
    This patch checks if a MythUIButtonListItem is visible and only calls
    the parent's Update() if it is visible thus speeding up the update
    and also reduces flicker when updating buttonlists with a large number of
    items.
    
    Based on a patch by Lawrence Rust.

    Subtitles: Fix state calculation in EnableCaptions/DisableCaptions.
    
    26f6437b874d84c87a52df6d33e449c0d5d9a4bc was too aggressive in
    assuming that EnableCaptions would actually enable text subtitles, and
    DisableCaptions would actually disable text subtitles.  They only
    enable/disable a particular type of subtitles (which may have already
    been enabled/disabled), so we need to check the overall state after
    the operation is performed.

    Subtitles: Allow transitions between ATSC and SCTE captions.
    
    In changeset d526385aa4c1466b064e9544cdb663f357007e35 (refs #9829),
    code was added such that the first time ATSC caption data is seen, any
    future SCTE caption data is explicitly ignored.  This was to deal with
    broadcasts containing duplicate caption data.
    
    This policy causes problems when the recording switches back and forth
    between the two sources of caption data, such as when the broadcaster
    splices in commercials.
    
    The updated solution continues to favor ATSC data, but allows a switch
    back to SCTE after SCTE data is seen 10 times in a row (a somewhat
    arbitrarily chosen number) without intervening ATSC data.

    Subtitles: Fix automatic display of captions/subtitles.
    
    There was something of a race condition in the previous code.  At
    startup of playback, the decoder thread runs ahead and updates track
    lists as it encounters them, including audio, cc608, cc708, etc.  If
    no subtitle tracks are found before the UI thread gets to a certain
    point, the UI thread commits to keeping subtitles disabled, regardless
    of the "automatically display subtitles" setting.
    
    In the new version, at startup of playback, the UI thread keeps the
    original intention alive so that subtitles will automatically start
    displaying when they eventually arrive.
    
    Note that this fix doesn't address the problem where the player ought
    to switch to a "better" subtitle track type when it comes along, such
    as switching from cc608 to cc708.
