    Check the value of this setting before starting up the MediaMonitor
    thread.  The check is placed here instead of earlier with the thought
    that these setting can eventually be responded to on the fly instead
    of requiring a restart.

    Fix the following issues
    * When an existing capture card is selected, Available devices
      shows "Manually enter". It should show the selected id.
    * When an existing capture card is selected the currently selected
      shows "warning already in use". It should only show that if it is
      in use on another tuner.
    * Device id must always be read-only. currently it is always updateable.
    * When "manually enter ip address" is selected, IP address and tuner
      should be updateable. They are not.
    * When updating ip address or tuner, the device id should be changed
      to match what is entered.
    * When editing an existing tuner, the tuner id shows as 0.
      It should show the correct value.

    Use mysql_options() to specify reconnection.
    
    MySQL added the option flag for specifying reconnection back in 2004,
    to be used instead of directly tweaking the bit inside a structure.
    Apparently MariaDB has finally removed the obsolete method of directly
    tweaking the reconnect bit.  This has been compile tested but not
    functionality tested.

    Use the define property flags when creating a RecordingInfo object.
    
    This code used a hard coded shift for adding the subtitle flags to the
    properties field, and that value hasn't kept up with the addition of
    new flags.  Change the hard coded number to a constant defined in the
    same location as the flags.  One reported visible side effect of this
    bug is that mythweb would indicate that most recording are damaged.
    This is the result of the subtitle "hard of hearing" flag being
    wrongly shifted into the position of the video damaged flag.

    "Lastupdated" field has changed, and seems likely to change, so make it a
    wildcard match. "Thumbauthor" field has also changed.
    2. Update "NOVA: Eclipse Over America" test case
    This appears to have moved from episode 18 to episode 11 and had updates
    to the description and other metadata.
    3. Ignore banner of just  "http://thetvdb.com/banners/"
    4. ignore user rating of 0
    5. correct handingly of genre
    They are a list of "<item>..</item>".
    6. Add new test case: ttvdb.py -l en -a GB -C 330432
    This had some regressions compared to v29.0 which are now fixed, so add a test case.

    Fixes #13096 - Previously Recorded screen only showing ancient history
    
    This affects people with more than 20000 items previously recorded.
    Short term fix does 2 things -
    * Shows the most recent 20000 items instead of a random 20000 items.
    * Adds a setting which can be used to override the default of 20000.
      Increasing it can be done by those with large histories they want to
      look at, but at the risk of slow responses and large memory use.
      Decreasing it can be useful for those with small low powered frontends.
    
    Long term fix is to redesign the '''previously recorded''' screen.

    Refs #10633 - Set default proxy for listening ports to NoProxy.
    
    The code was using http proxy as the default for listening ports, and
    in most cases overriding it to NoProxy. Http proxies do not make
    sense for listening ports, so default to NoProxy unless the code
    specifically requests otherwise when creating the server socket.
