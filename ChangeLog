    The classes defined in httplivestreambuffer.cpp were originally designed for
    
    HLS playback, and are inefficient for recording.  Create a new
    recorder-specific HLS processing class called HLSReader.  Since it is
    specifically designed for recording, HLSReader is more efficient and faster.

    Improve the performance of Live TV embedded in the Program Guide.
    
    Most of the Program Guide's DB and backend queries are moved out of
    the UI loop into a background helper thread, to minimize the chance
    of the embedded Live TV window stuttering.
    
    More work can and should be done to pre-cache scheduler data and
    channel tuning status, and to have the backend invalidate/update it
    when there are changes.
    
    The background computation introduces some guide navigation UI
    oddities, where the expensive-to-compute elements (the list of
    channels) update on the screen slower than other elements.
    
    There is still some slight stuttering on a single-core ION frontend,
    but most frontends should see a vast or complete reduction in Guide
    navigation stuttering.

    MythZoneMinder: get a normal frame image if an analysis image is not available
    
    Continuous (record) events don't produce any alarm frames so no analysis images

    alarm events so fall back to returning a normal frame image if no analysis
    image is found.

    Not every frame is stored in the database for continuous events so their

    automatically through the housekeeper, to ensure logging arguments are

    Allow Live TV to be entered from the top-level Program Guide.
    
    This allows the user to start Live TV on a specific channel from the
    Program Guide grid.  Otherwise, the user needs to wait for Live TV to
    start and tune the initial channel, then find the channel actually
    wanted, and wait for it to be tuned.  This also provides a workaround
    when the default initial channel is untunable for some reason.
    
    Currently, if the desired channel is not tunable (e.g., all capable
    recorders are already busy), it will fail.

    Add mythutil --getmarkup and mythutil --setmarkup commands.
    
    This extracts the contents of the recordedmarkup, recordedseek, and
    filemarkup tables to or from a local xml file.  The primary reason is
    to allow users to extract recorder seektable information as needed and
    attach it to a ticket, for a developer to use for debugging.  Example:
    
      mythutil --chanid xxx --starttime yyy --getmarkup /tmp/markup.xml
      mythutil --video zzz.mpg --setmarkup /tmp/markup.xml
    
    An added benefit is to be able to copy metadata (e.g. seektable,
    commskiplist, cutlist) between isolated MythTV instances.

    Add missing toUTC() conversions in the preview generator.
    
    Without these conversions, modification timestamps on
    backend-generated preview files are reported in local time, but
    interpreted by the frontend as UTC.  The frontend then converts this
    to local time and uses that to set the modification timestamp of the
    locally cached preview, effectively back-dating the cached file in
    most time zones.  This messes up date comparison logic for determining
    whether to regenerate or reload the preview image.

    Improve AirPlay device visibility in iOS 7
    
    For some reasons, my iPhone doesnât always show mythtv as an AirPlay device, and more often than not only show it as an audio device.
    After playing a lot with the various bonjour advertising data, what I can gather is:
    - If AirPlay video reports a version >= 120.x; the iPhone will attempt to use FairPlay DRM no matter what RAOP reports (even if it reports no support for encryption)
    - If thereâs a mismatch of version between AirPlay video and RAOP: the iPhone 5 wonât show the video service
    - If reporting a version < 110 in AirPlay video, then photo sharing doesnât reliably work
    - If bit 10 in features bitmask is cleared, it doesnât reliably show up
    So I set the AirPlay video version to 115.3 (made up value) that allows photo sharing, and RAOP also to 115.3 and it all seem to work nicely now

    Provide better seeking and position display for some videos.
    
    Specifically, there are examples of poorly-encoded avi files that
    report a video frame rate of 30fps but the video stream is actually
    24fps.  Because frame intervals are actually encoded as 30fps, every
    4th frame has to be repeated.  Without an adjustment to framesPlayed,
    translations between MythPlayer's frame-based seeking/display and
    ffmpeg's timecode-based seeking drift out of sync.
    
    Note: Similar adjustments may be necessary if frames have to be
    dropped due to a frame rate mismatch.

    Fix startup 'wait for client' check that assumed the client would be non-blocking. It's possible for a frontend to connect to the backend, then go idle before we re-checked for it's presence, which would have prevented the backend shutting down. If _any_ client is connected, then release the block on shutdown.

    Wakeup the backend to run mythfilldatabase
    
    This uses MythFillSuggestedRunTime, for xmltv sources (+24 hours), for
    datadirect whatever time was suggested by TMS to ensure that we always
    wake up the backend to collect guide data (xmltv, DD only, EIT is not
    yet supported). Using MythFillSuggestedRunTime is a bit of a hack, but
    it's already set for Schedules Direct so this was the simplest
    solution.
    
    For now the "Run guide data program at time suggested by the grabber"
    setting MUST be enabled for this to work as intended.
    
    Without this fix the backend won't wake up to grab guide data from
    xmltv/SD sources and that may result in it eventually running out of data
    entirely.

    MythZoneMinder: fix the grabbing of the live stream images
    
    * Add a missing field to the ShareData struct added it later ZM versions
    * Change the minimum supported ZM version to 1.24.0.
    * Remove the v4l2 hack
    
    Note: this bumps the MythZoneMinder protocol version so both the FE plugin
    and mythzmserver need to be updated.

    Change RI::ForgetHistory() to use dupmethod when available.
    
    Previously, ForgetHistory() implicily used subtitle and description as
    the duplicate check method.  Consequently, it doesn't always match
    correctly when other methods are used and there are guide changes in
    data that should be ignored.  In addition, don't assume any dupmethod
    in the Previously Recorded screen to avoid being to overzealous when
    called from there.

    MythMusic: fix playback of ogg radio streams
    
    Peek the probe data from the stream buffer rather than read the data otherwise
    ffmpeg fails to open the stream because the magic it is looking for has already
    been read from the stream.
    
    Also increase the probe buffer to 16K this seems to be required for some ogg
    streams to be probed properly.

    Allow system calls to pull global settings from the database.
    
    This adjusts the System() class to first try local settings of the
    supplied value, fall back to global settings, and then the supplied
    default, before finally erroring. This corrects an issue where the
    VideoGrabber() child class did not properly pull the global settings for
    TelevisionGrabber and MovieGrabber, and thus just used the internal
    defaults.
