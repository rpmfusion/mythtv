    Fix for Synaesthesia memory corruption
    
    We were allocating just half the required space and consequently
    writing beyond the end of the array. This consistently caused
    segfaults for me when using the Synaesthesia visualiser.
    
    This fix appears to be consistent with the code used in other projects
    which were also derived from the original Synaesthia project.
    
    e.g. GStreamer/Source/gst-plugins-ugly/gst/synaesthesia/synaescope.c

    Rework IP selection so link-local is always used.
    
    This adds an option to mythtv-setup that makes link-local addresses
    listened to by default.  This behavior can still be disabled, to block
    off network access.
