    Null pointer check in MainServer::customEvent.
    
    There are a few backtraces from ubuntu users appearing to show a crash here with
    a null event pointer. It's not possible to work backwards and see how a null
    event managed to end up being posted in the first place, and this
    change won't necessarily prevent all variations of this crash but it's
    the best I can do for now without a full audit of all code using the
    events system.

    MythUIImage: extend the random image feature to reload if a delay is used
    
    If the <filename> is set to a directory and the <delay> is set to a value > 0
    then keep reloading a random image from the directory after <delay>
    milliseconds has passed.
    
    For example this will display a random image from the themes 'background'
    directory changing the image every minute (60000ms) :-
    
    <imagetype name="background">
        <area>0,0,1280,720</area>
        <filename>backgrounds/</filename>
