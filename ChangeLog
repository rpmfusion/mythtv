    Serialization Implementation for XML: gcc6/Qt5.{6,7} SEGVs
    
    This isn't a MythTV bug, rather an issue with Qt5.{6,7,??}
    and gcc version 6. This will get Arch users with the above
    combinations working until a proper solution is developed.
    
    In XmlSerializer::GetContentName when pMetaObject is NULL,
    a SEGV fires rather that getting a -1 return from
    pMetaObject->indexOfClassInfo().
    
    Examples: <be>:6544/Myth/version and <be>:6544/Myth/GetHostName.
    Both fail on Arch linux with the above combinations.
    
    Thanks for the research on: bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1631996,
    testing on the ticket, and the reference to:
    http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2016-March/025153.html

    Previously, it essentially acted as if it had a one entry queue.
    Consequently, if multiple recordings started at the same time, all but
    the first would have to wait causing them to be delayed, sometimes by
    several seconds.  Now, none of them have to wait.

    Work around a suspected Qt bug affecting some settings.
    
    There is a suspected bug in some versions of Qt, notably in version
    5.6.1 in Debian, where calling QVariant::toString() returns garbage if
    the MySQL type is TINYINT.  Because MythTV does this for all settings,
    it is possible for a setting to lose its previous value when a
    settings dialog is entered.  The work around is to have MySQL cast the
    value to a string type before it gets to MythTV.  Thanks to Karl Dietz
    for suggesting this fix.

    HTTP Server: Provide additional CORS support
    
    This commit adds a new AllowedOriginsList setting that
    stores a comma separated list of Origins. If the setting
    is missing, the list defaults to:
    
        https://chromecast.mythtv.org
        http://chromecast.mythtvcast.com
    
    Access-Control-Allow -Credentials and -Headers were also
    added to the response to support Chromecast.
    
    A TODO item is closed by adding the hostname to
    the existing list of IP addresses (no change in
    the ports checked.)
    
    Note that previously, if ResponseTypeFile was found, the
    CORS header wasn't being added. This caused the Chromecast
    feature to fail.
    
    There is no GUI. Clients have the ability to change the value
    with the Services API. May need to rethink using settings as
    this is a security risk.
    
    For example, it a valid Origin exists in the request, the
    following will appear in the response:
    
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
        Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
    
    If there is no match, an existing critical log will fire:
    
        Cross-origin request received with origin (https://example.net)
    
    Missing http://, https:// or a '*' character in list entries will
    be ignored, and the following will be logged:
    
        Illegal AllowedOriginsList entry '*'. Must start with http[s]:// and not be *

    Python: Restore chanId/startTime API for recordings
    
    Exisiting python scripts depend on the Recorded class taking the chanid/starttime instead of the recordedid as the primary key.
    This patch updates the Recorded class to continue using the chanid/starttime pair.
    A future patch can add recordedid as a second option so as not to break backwards compatibility.
