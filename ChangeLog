    Protect the reschedule queue with a seperate lock to fix a backend deadlock.
    
     Fixes a deadlock in mythbackend caused when a reschedule request occurs
     immedately prior to a recording starting.
    
     The recorder thread locks the scheduler when starting a recording. The pending
     reschedule request handled in the event loop waits for the scheduler lock to be
     released blocking the event loop. The backend is now stopped from handling any
     further events or protocol requests, meanwhile the recorder is waiting on
     events to be processed before it will release the lock resulting in an
     irrecoverable deadlock (or hang) and the failure of the recording.
    
     This deadlock was more likely to be triggered for users of EIT because it will
     ask for a reschedule every 5 minutes in addition to any reschedules triggered
     through other means.

    Revert "Protect the reschedule queue with a seperate lock to fix a backend deadlock."
    
    This reverts commit 5eb97790f3c36f9d2524275e545189cafda9d48a.
    
    While this seems to work well in master, it appears to make the
    situation worse in 0.25 and I really don't have the time to figure out
    why. Anyone experiencing the pre-existing deadlock will need to
    upgrade to 0.26 when it's released. Refs #10771

    Move QUERY_FILETRANSFER handling to improve backend performance.
    
    This significantly reduces the backend CPU usage for me when streaming a
    recording or other file to the frontend.
    
    Each time we send a command to the backend we perform a number of string
    comparisons to find the correct handler. In the cases where that same command
    is sent regularly, maybe several times a second those comparisons can stack up
    to result in a high CPU load. This can be avoided by moving the most frequently
    used commands to the top of the list thereby avoiding a couple of dozen or more
    comparisons each time.
    
    There may be other commands that should be moved to the top with similar
    benefit.

    Subtitles: Be less aggressive about auto-selecting a forced track.
    
    1. Don't favor a forced subtitle track if DefaultCCMode=1 (i.e., the
    user already wants subtitles or captions which are likely to also
    contain the force subtitles).
    
    2. Don't favor a forced subtitle track if AllowForcedSubtitles=0
    (i.e., the user doesn't want to be inflicted with forced subtitles).
    
    3. Only favor a forced track if it is a subtitle track.  (Do any other
    track types ever have the forced flag set?)
    
    Note that this still may not be perfect, e.g. a user may end up
    auto-displaying cc608 captions where a forced subtitle track is still
    needed for the complete experience.

    actually querying TMDB once the cache stored more than ~100 entries.
