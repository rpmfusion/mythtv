    Apply preroll on virtual tuners when the same multiplex is in use.
    
    Previously, if any tuner in the same input group was already busy,
    preroll would not be applied.  Now, if the recording on the other
    input is on the same multiplex as the new recording, preroll will be
    applied.

    Never attempt to read more than in 512kB blocks
    
    Recalculate the threshold and read block size when we've encountered EOF several times in a row.
    512kB ought to be enough to read a file smoothly (famous last words)
    
    This reduces the amount of unnecessary verbosity. When watching a SD 3Mbit/s DVB stream, it will take over a second to get 1MB of data, leading to a warning entry in the log for every single read.

    Allow seeking within the entire liveTV chain of recordings.
    
    Seeking across liveTV was fundamentally broken. You could only seek within the current recordings or go to the beginning of the next one or 15s to the end of the previous one.
    This changes correct this behaviour. It is now possible to seek across the entire live TV session. We ensure however that we do not seek further than 15s from the end of a recordings (3s if reaching end of live program).

    Prevent playback to exit early should backend's writes be delayed
    
    Typical scenario is when watching on-going recordings and being very close to real time TV: should the backend take more than 360ms between two writes, the reader would treat it as an EOF and abort the read.
    
    When encountering EOF, we now check if the file is being written to in parallel and if so wait.
    
    We can also remove all EOF retries in FileRingBuffer::safe_read() as we definitely know now if we did reach EOF (as we check against the file size).
    This allows for almost instantaneous program transition in live TV.

    Have backend advertise which files are currently being written to
    
    It is necessary in some playback scenarios to know if a file being read is currently being written to. This is useful in determining when encountering EOF if we should wait for more data or abort the read.
    
    MythCoreContext will now keep track of files as they are being opened for writing
    Connected frontends will receive the information via the event socket in the form of a BACKEND_MESSAGE event.
    
    The myth protocol is extended with two new BACKEND_MESSAGE events:
    FILE_WRITTEN: Sent when a file is opened in write mode, and when the file is being written to (at most every 10s)
    FILE_CLOSED: Sent when the file opened in write mode is closed.
    
    The myth protocol version doesnâ€™t have to be increased as frontends will make use of it only if available and the changes are backward compatible with exiting myth protocol.

    Fix fileringbuffer locking up on read()
    
    From time to time, most often seen during LiveTV, FileRingBuffer::safe_read() would lock and not return for a long time (on my system, it would block in excess of 20s).
    Upon investigation, the issue occurs while reading a file currently being written to, if a call to read() encountered EOF, returned early and a following call to read() was made, before another write. Under those conditions, read() wouldn't return for a long time, causing the backend to abort the read and dropping the frontend connection.
    
    So instead we now check the size of the current file via a call to POSIX fstat and never try to read beyond the EOF position.
    If the file being read isn't a regular, or fstat returned an error, the old behaviour is used: read until we get as much data as we asked.
    
    Surprisingly, this has fixed most of the issues I've been having for years with liveTV:
    - Stuttering or temporary free when close to the live
    - Freeze at program transition.
    
    Add debugging information while in file mode

    MetaIO: validate the files extension before creating a tagger
    
    This checks the file extension is one we know how to handle before
    creating the tagger. Return NULL if not valid.
    
    This fixes a bug with the music file scanner trying to add files with an
    unknown file extension.
    
    NOTE: bumps the ABI version so compile and install myth core before compiling
    the plugins

    MythMusic: fix playback of some radio stations
    
    Make sure the maximum size of the QTCPSocket read buffer is set appropriately.
    
    This seems to throttle the sending of readyRead() signals sent to us from
    QTCPSocket better otherwise once we fill our buffer and don't read anything in the
    readyRead() slot the QTCPSocket will eventually not send any more signals causing
    us to run out of data.
    
    Fixes #11872.

    Improve the performance of Live TV embedded in the Program Guide.
    
    Most of the Program Guide's DB and backend queries are moved out of
    the UI loop into a background helper thread, to minimize the chance
    of the embedded Live TV window stuttering.
    
    More work can and should be done to pre-cache scheduler data and
    channel tuning status, and to have the backend invalidate/update it
    when there are changes.
    
    The background computation introduces some guide navigation UI
    oddities, where the expensive-to-compute elements (the list of
    channels) update on the screen slower than other elements.
    
    There is still some slight stuttering on a single-core ION frontend,
    but most frontends should see a vast or complete reduction in Guide
    navigation stuttering.

    MythZoneMinder: get a normal frame image if an analysis image is not available
    
    Continuous (record) events don't produce any alarm frames so no analysis images
    are produced.  It is also possible to turn analysis image creation off even for
    alarm events so fall back to returning a normal frame image if no analysis
    image is found.

    Allow Live TV to be entered from the top-level Program Guide.
    
    This allows the user to start Live TV on a specific channel from the
    Program Guide grid.  Otherwise, the user needs to wait for Live TV to
    start and tune the initial channel, then find the channel actually
    wanted, and wait for it to be tuned.  This also provides a workaround
    when the default initial channel is untunable for some reason.
    
    Currently, if the desired channel is not tunable (e.g., all capable
    recorders are already busy), it will fail.

    Add mythutil --getmarkup and mythutil --setmarkup commands.
    
    This extracts the contents of the recordedmarkup, recordedseek, and
    filemarkup tables to or from a local xml file.  The primary reason is
    to allow users to extract recorder seektable information as needed and
    attach it to a ticket, for a developer to use for debugging.  Example:
    
      mythutil --chanid xxx --starttime yyy --getmarkup /tmp/markup.xml
      mythutil --video zzz.mpg --setmarkup /tmp/markup.xml
    
    An added benefit is to be able to copy metadata (e.g. seektable,
    commskiplist, cutlist) between isolated MythTV instances.

    Add missing toUTC() conversions in the preview generator.
    
    Without these conversions, modification timestamps on
    backend-generated preview files are reported in local time, but
    interpreted by the frontend as UTC.  The frontend then converts this
    to local time and uses that to set the modification timestamp of the
    locally cached preview, effectively back-dating the cached file in
    most time zones.  This messes up date comparison logic for determining
    whether to regenerate or reload the preview image.

    Add secondary check to prevent housekeeper task from running twice.
    
    This adds an extra check to prevent a HouseKeeperTask from running
    more than once simultaneously. This prevents an issue seen in a
    misconfigured child task that was queued in concurrent passes. One
    instance had not yet finished when the second one started a minute
    later, and overwrote a shared pointer, eventually resulting in a
    segmentation fault.

    Improve AirPlay device visibility in iOS 7
    
    For some reasons, my iPhone doesnâ€™t always show mythtv as an AirPlay device, and more often than not only show it as an audio device.
    After playing a lot with the various bonjour advertising data, what I can gather is:
    - If AirPlay video reports a version >= 120.x; the iPhone will attempt to use FairPlay DRM no matter what RAOP reports (even if it reports no support for encryption)
    - If thereâ€™s a mismatch of version between AirPlay video and RAOP: the iPhone 5 wonâ€™t show the video service
    - If reporting a version < 110 in AirPlay video, then photo sharing doesnâ€™t reliably work
    - If bit 10 in features bitmask is cleared, it doesnâ€™t reliably show up
    So I set the AirPlay video version to 115.3 (made up value) that allows photo sharing, and RAOP also to 115.3 and it all seem to work nicely now

    Provide better seeking and position display for some videos.
    
    Specifically, there are examples of poorly-encoded avi files that
    report a video frame rate of 30fps but the video stream is actually
    24fps.  Because frame intervals are actually encoded as 30fps, every
    4th frame has to be repeated.  Without an adjustment to framesPlayed,
    translations between MythPlayer's frame-based seeking/display and
    ffmpeg's timecode-based seeking drift out of sync.
    
    Note: Similar adjustments may be necessary if frames have to be
    dropped due to a frame rate mismatch.

    Fix startup 'wait for client' check that assumed the client would be non-blocking. It's possible for a frontend to connect to the backend, then go idle before we re-checked for it's presence, which would have prevented the backend shutting down. If _any_ client is connected, then release the block on shutdown.

    Wakeup the backend to run mythfilldatabase
    
    This uses MythFillSuggestedRunTime, for xmltv sources (+24 hours), for
    datadirect whatever time was suggested by TMS to ensure that we always
    wake up the backend to collect guide data (xmltv, DD only, EIT is not
    yet supported). Using MythFillSuggestedRunTime is a bit of a hack, but
    it's already set for Schedules Direct so this was the simplest
    solution.
    
    For now the "Run guide data program at time suggested by the grabber"
    setting MUST be enabled for this to work as intended.
    
    Without this fix the backend won't wake up to grab guide data from
    xmltv/SD sources and that may result in it eventually running out of data
    entirely.

    Have pager return Nones if the server returns null.
    
    This temporarily resolves an issue where the TheMovieDb server returns
    nulls in searches when a movie has been deleted but not yet flushed out
    of the cache. This prevents the error internally, but does not attempt
    to re-order to remove the nulls, so is merely passing the issue onto the
    application using this library.
