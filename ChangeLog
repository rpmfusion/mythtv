    Fix the missing teletext subtitle problem
    
    Implements "Teletext Magazin Serial Mode".
    
    Only Parallel Mode was implemented, therefor some subtitles where not
    displayed when there where not enough teletext page changes in the
    magazin where the subtitle pages where gathered. In Magazin Serial
    Mode any new page finishes the previously gathered teletext pages
    independently of the magazin of the new page.
    
    Fixes #13016

    Use correct ping timeout parameter for the operating system.
    
    The ping command on Linux based operating systems uses the -w
    paremeter to specify the timeout in seconds.  The ping command on
    FreeBSD based operating systems uses the -t parameter.  Use compile
    time flags to generate the right ping command for the operating
    system.  This fixes #12034.

    Refs #10633 - Set default proxy for listening ports to NoProxy.
    
    The code was using http proxy as the default for listening ports, and
    in most cases overriding it to NoProxy. Http proxies do not make
    sense for listening ports, so default to NoProxy unless the code
    specifically requests otherwise when creating the server socket.
