    Internet Content: Replace precompiled vimeo_data.pyc with the source vimeo_data.py.
    
    vimeo_data.pyc was byte-compiled for python 2.6 and didn't work with any other
    python versions.
    
    vimeo_data.py holds the API key for connecting to vimeo.  It it obfuscated,
    however other projects do keep their key in the open.

    Internet Content: Adapt the YouTube grabber to the v3 API
    
    It is possible to set two optional parameters in ~/.mythtv/MythNetvision/userGrabberPrefs/youtube.xml:
    * API key
    * Region code used for retrieving the categories in the tree view
    
    Some changes were also required in libmyth and MythNetvision due to the way
    paging is handled.
    
    This bumps the ABI version.
