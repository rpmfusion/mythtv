    Fix crash in ProgramMapTable::Create
    
    Abort in libmythtv due to accessing beyond the size of the vector.
    
    With at least some recording sources (I am using an OCUR device) it is
    apparently possible to end up having zero descriptors in the stream
    when ProgramMapTable::Create is called, but GCC 8 (and libstdc++) now
    includes AddressSanitizer integration for std::vector, detecting
    out-of-range accesses to a vector, which means that referencing the
    0th element is now an error (and an abort) even though the called code
    would not typically copy any data.
    
    Patch from Gary Buhrmaster, fixes #13263.

    Fix crash (abort) in MythSocket::ResetReal
    
    In libmythbase mythsocket.cpp MythSocket::ResetReal there can be cases
    where there are no bytes to available to read, so the vector is never
    resized to greater than zero, which results in an abort when
    referencing the 1st (non-existant) element which is now checked by
    gcc8 (libstdc++).
    
    Patch from Gary Buhrmaster, fixes #13264.

    Stop active EIT scans from interfering with recordings
    
    Because DiSEqC inputs no longer share file descriptors, extra care
    must be taken with active EIT scans to prevent them from holding an
    open file descripter and causing recordings to fail.  This change more
    aggressively stops active scans when recordings are pending and also
    releases all resources when they are stopped.
    
    Many, many, many thanks go to jmwislez at gmail.com for being so
    patient and trying so many patches to identify and ultimately fix the
    problem.

    Fix issues with inputs that support multiple, physical connections
    
    There was some superflous and flat out wrong code left over from the
    card/input to input conversion that prevented inputs from switching
    among connections like tuner, s-video and composite.  Thanks to
    ltskinol@gmail.com for doing most of the leg work and testing the
    fixes.

    Allow the SignalHandler's StreamHandler to be used by the Recorder.
    
    Currently only supported by the External Recorder, this allows the data seen
    by the Signal Monitor to be used by the recorder.  This is helpful for
    'slow' recorders, and the IPTV recorder would also benifit.
