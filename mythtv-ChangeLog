    Updated "Remove duplicates" channel scan option
    
    Renamed the feature from "Remove duplicate channels" to "Remove duplicates".
    Changed the default for this option to Selected/Checked.
    Removed the check on individual channels across all scanned channels.
    The implementation does not check for original network ID plus transport ID
    on a per-transport basis, as suggested in ticket #12107 for DVB, but it checks
    this on all channels in the transport. The implementation is also expected to work for ATSC.
    Thanks to John Pilkington for numerous tests in the daily changing UK Freeview landscape.

    Scan option "Remove duplicate channels"
    
    Add new scan option to remove duplicate transports and duplicate
    channels based on signal strength of the received signal.
    This can be useful when receiving DVB-T2 and other OTA signals
    when the same channels can sometimes be received from more than
    one transmitter on different frequencies.

    Add Full Scan option for DVB-C Netherlands
    
    Add an entry in the frequency tables for a "Full Scan" option
    for DVB-C in The Netherlands. There is currently only one entry
    which is the initial tuning frequency of the Ziggo network.

    Signal strength of scanned transports
    
    Show the signal strength of the scanned transports in the transport list.
    The transport list is shown if the "-v chanscan" option is given when running mythtv-setup.
    The signal strengths are useful to determine which transport to choose when identical
    transports can be received from different transmitters on different frequencies.

    Wait for NIT or MGT when scanning
    
    In mythtv-setup channel scan, wait for a NIT or a MGT when the
    PAT/PMT have been found. This solves the problem that sometimes
    channels are found but the channel names are missing.
